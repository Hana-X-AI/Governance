- **In Progress**: Actively being investigated or fixed
- **Resolved**: Fix implemented and ready for verification
- **Closed**: Fix verified and accepted
- **Deferred**: Postponed to future release

**Severity Definitions**:
- **Critical**: System crash, data loss, security breach, complete feature failure
- **High**: Major functionality broken, significant performance degradation, no workaround
- **Medium**: Feature partially working, workaround available, minor performance impact
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconvenience, enhancement request

**Priority Definitions**:
- **P0**: Fix immediately, blocks release
- **P1**: Fix in current sprint/iteration
- **P2**: Fix in next sprint/iteration
- **P3**: Fix when time permits

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Reporting New Defects
1. Assign unique ID (D-###)
2. Set severity based on impact
3. Provide clear reproduction steps
4. Include environment details
5. Attach relevant screenshots/logs
6. Update defect summary table

### Updating Defects
1. Log all activities with date and name
2. Update status as work progresses
3. Document root cause when identified
4. Describe resolution when fixed
5. Update target fix date if changed

### Resolving Defects
1. Implement fix
2. Add/update tests
3. Update status to Resolved
4. Notify reporter for verification
5. Move to Recently Resolved section

### Closing Defects
1. Verify fix in appropriate environment
2. Confirm with reporter
3. Update status to Closed
4. Move to Recently Closed section
