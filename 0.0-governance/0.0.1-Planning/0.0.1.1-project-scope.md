## Project Scope Statement

The **Hana-X AI Development and Testing Ecosystem Implementation Project** aims to establish a fully integrated, end-to-end hybrid platform to support AI solution development, validation, and deployment. The environment will provide a structured foundation for the Hana-X AI program by enabling controlled development, testing, and integration across multiple infrastructure layers.

This ecosystem is built on **100% locally hosted infrastructure**, where each server node has a clearly defined role and responsibility to ensure performance, reliability, and separation of functions. The **hybrid aspect** of the platform is achieved through containerized applications, enabling flexible development, testing, and deployment across both on-premise and cloud environments.

### Phase 1 Objectives

This phase focuses on **platform setup and readiness**. Core objectives include:

- **Provisioning and configuration** of all designated server nodes within the Hana-X environment.
- **Domain integration** by joining each server to the `hx.dev.local` Active Directory domain for centralized identity and policy management.
- **Deployment of foundational software components** required to support each nodeâ€™s functional role (e.g., database, application, vector, and orchestration layers).
- **Infrastructure reference:** The platform infrastructure consists of **30 on-premises server nodes** (detailed in the *Hana-X Platform Nodes â€” Capabilities & Status* document). Each node has a defined functional scope within the identity, data, AI model, agentic, or application layer.

Upon completion, the platform will serve as the **baseline environment** for subsequent phases focused on application development, containerized test orchestration, and continuous integration workflows.

### Implementation Strategy

The Hana-X AI Ecosystem Implementation leverages **Claude Code** as the primary **systems integrator**. Claude Code orchestrates and coordinates the creation of specialized **AI sub-agents**, each responsible for discrete phases of deliveryâ€”including planning, design, implementation, and testing of platform capabilities.

These agents collaborate closely with **Hana-X (HX)** technical and program resources to form a unified project team executing the buildout of the platformâ€™s foundational components. This integrated approach ensures consistent alignment between automation, architecture, and governance throughout delivery.

During this phase, the team will develop a series of **proofs of concept (PoCs)** to validate the platformâ€™s performance, scalability, and high-availability characteristics. Successful completion of these PoCs will confirm readiness for the next phaseâ€”**AI application development and testing** within the Hana-X roadmap.

### Roles and Responsibilities

The **Hana-X project team** is led by **Jarvis Richardson**, **Chief AI Officer (CAIO)** for Hana-X.Aiâ€”also known as **Agent Zero (AZ)**. Acting as **Project Sponsor and Program Lead**, AZ serves as the **single point of contact** between **Claude Code** and the internal Hana-X team, providing strategic, technical, and governance oversight across all phases.

The **Claude Code systems integrator** functions through a network of specialized **AI Agents**, each focused on a discrete technology or operational function. These agents collaborate with Hana-X resources to design, deploy, and validate all components of the Hana-X AI Ecosystem.

All Claude Code operations and artifacts are hosted on the **dedicated integration server**, `hx-cc-server (192.168.10.224)`. Local knowledge, configuration, and training data for each agent are maintained in the **/srv/knowledge/vault** directoryâ€”the central knowledge repository supporting continuity, training, and operational excellence.

**7. Business & Technical Leadership**  
-- **Project Management Agent** – Oversees planning, task creation, tracking, and reporting. Coordinates inter-agent work and prioritizes activities using templates from `/<project-name>/0.0-governance/templates`..  
- **Business Analyst Agent** â€“ Defines business use cases, requirements, and user interaction flows (Mermaid). Aligns delivery with business intent and coordinates across agents.  
- **Architect Agent** â€“ Defines agentic patterns (stored in `/srv/knowledge/vault/agentic-design-patterns-docs-main`), maintains architecture diagrams, technical designs, and data-flow documentation. Engages specialized agents as required.  
- **Senior Application Developer Agent** â€“ Leads development execution, enforces OOP standards, conducts unit testing, manages defect resolution, and can spawn multiple instances for parallel workstreams.

### Collaboration Model

Claude Code Agents operate in a synchronized workflow orchestrated by the `hx-cc-server`. Each category contributes modular outputs that integrate into the Hana-X platform architecture. This model promotes **accountability, scalability, and traceability**, ensuring all agent activities align with program milestones and governance standards.

This coordination extends across all operational nodes listed in the *Hana-X Platform Nodes â€” Capabilities & Status* document, which defines each agentâ€™s execution and data interaction context.

---

### Governance & Communication Framework

Project governance is anchored by the **Hana-X Project Constitution**, defining the **core principles, standards, and coordination protocols** that guide all activities within the `hx.dev.local` ecosystem.

The Constitution serves as the **supreme governing document**, establishing the framework for decision-making, collaboration, and quality assurance across all teams and agents. Every participantâ€”regardless of function or specializationâ€”must operate in full alignment with these principles.

In the event of conflict between the Constitution and any procedural guidance, the **Constitution takes precedence** as the final authority for team conduct, inter-agent coordination, and delivery standards across the Hana-X AI Ecosystem.

### Conclusion

The **Hana-X AI Development and Testing Ecosystem** represents a pivotal step toward realizing Hana-X.Aiâ€™s vision for intelligent, adaptive, and scalable AI operations. Through disciplined governance, defined agent roles, and an integrated hybrid architecture, the project establishes both the **technical** and **procedural backbone** for future innovation. With the platform implementation phase now in motion, the team is well-positioned to advance into application development, validation, and continuous improvementâ€”solidifying Hana-X as a leader in AI-driven enterprise transformation.

### Appendix B â€” File System Structure

The Hana-X AI Ecosystem project maintains two primary file system hierarchies on `hx-cc-server (192.168.10.224)`:

| **Purpose** | **Path** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Project Root | `/<project-name>` | Primary project directory |
| Governance Docs | `/<project-name>/governance` | Project governance documents (scope, architecture, deployment) |
| Templates | `/<project-name>/0.0-governance/templates` | Project management templates, workflows |
| Patterns (Selected) | `/<project-name>/0.0-governance/patterns` | Selected agentic patterns in active use |
| Knowledge Vault | `/srv/knowledge/vault` | Large knowledge repository, agent training data, configuration |
| Pattern Library | `/srv/knowledge/vault/agentic-design-patterns-docs-main` | Complete agentic design pattern library |

**Key Directories:**

**Governance Directory** (`/<project-name>/0.0-governance/`):
- Contains project governance documents including scope, architecture, deployment methodologies, and standards
- **templates/**: Stores reusable templates for project management, reporting, and agent workflows
- **patterns/**: Contains selected subset of agentic patterns currently in use (sourced from knowledge vault)

**Knowledge Vault** (`/srv/knowledge/vault/`):
- Central knowledge repository for all agent training data, configuration, and operational knowledge
- **agentic-design-patterns-docs-main/**: Complete library of agentic design patterns
- Patterns are selected from this library and moved to governance/patterns/ as they are adopted

All agents reference these paths for coordination, configuration, and knowledge continuity.
