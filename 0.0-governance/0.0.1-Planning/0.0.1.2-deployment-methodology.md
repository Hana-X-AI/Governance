# Hana-X Deployment Methodology

**Document Type**: Methodology  
**Created**: November 2, 2025  
**Topic**: Deployment Process & Procedures  
**Purpose**: Define standardized deployment procedures for Hana-X platform services  
**Classification**: Internal - Governance  

---

## Document Purpose

This methodology defines the **systematic process for deploying services** within the Hana-X AI Ecosystem. It provides the step-by-step framework that agents and team members follow to safely, consistently, and successfully deploy new services or update existing ones.

This document **assumes familiarity** with the governance framework and focuses specifically on the deployment process. It referencesâ€”but does not repeatâ€”information already documented in other governance materials.

---

## 1. Document Context & Prerequisites

### 1.1 Position in Governance Framework

This methodology is a **tier-2 operational document** that implements principles defined in tier-1 governance:

```
Tier 1: Foundational Governance
â”œâ”€â”€ Hana-X Agent Constitution (supreme authority)
â”œâ”€â”€ Hana-X Project Scope (strategic vision)
â”œâ”€â”€ Hana-X Platform Nodes (infrastructure inventory)
â””â”€â”€ Hana-X Ecosystem Architecture (system design)

Tier 2: Operational Methodology â† THIS DOCUMENT
â””â”€â”€ HX Deployment Methodology (how we deploy)

Tier 3: Execution Artifacts (created during deployment)
â”œâ”€â”€ Deployment Plans (service-specific)
â”œâ”€â”€ Task Documentation (per-deployment)
â””â”€â”€ Post-Deployment Reports (lessons learned)
```

### 1.2 Required Reading Before Deployment

**All agents participating in deployment MUST have read:**

1. **Hana-X Agent Constitution** - Understand quality principles, agent coordination, escalation protocols
2. **Hana-X Ecosystem Architecture** - Understand 6-layer architecture, integration patterns, security model
3. **Hana-X Platform Nodes** - Know the 30-server topology and current status

**Reference Locations:**
```
/<project-name>/0.0-governance/
â”œâ”€â”€ hx-agent-constitution.md
â”œâ”€â”€ hana_x_ecosystem_architecture_final.md
â”œâ”€â”€ hana_x_platform_nodes_final.md
â””â”€â”€ hana_x_project_scope_final.md
```

### 1.3 Authority & Precedence

**In case of conflict:**
1. Constitution (supreme authority)
2. Architecture (technical design decisions)
3. This Methodology (process guidance)

**If methodology guidance conflicts with Constitution:** Constitution wins. Update this methodology.

**If unsure:** Escalate per Constitution Section XV (Escalation Protocol).

---

## 2. Methodology Overview

### 2.1 The HX Deployment Approach

**Philosophy**: Plan extensively, execute methodically, validate continuously, learn iteratively.

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Task-Based**: Sequential steps with clear entry/exit criteria
- **Validated**: Each task includes validation before proceeding
- **Coordinated**: Multiple agents collaborate using Constitution protocols
- **Documented**: Real-time documentation, not post-facto
- **Iterative**: Each deployment improves the methodology

### 2.2 Deployment Phases

```

### 2.3 Agent Coordination Model

**Deployment involves multiple specialized agents:**

| Phase | Lead Agent | Supporting Agents | Coordination |
|-------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Planning** | Service specialist | R5-D4 (docs), Architect (future) | Plan creation, template usage |
| **Prerequisites** | Service specialist | Chewbacca (infra), BB-8 (OS) | Serial handoffs per Constitution |
| **Deployment** | Service specialist | BB-8 (service management) | Coordination as needed |
| **Post-Deployment** | Service specialist | All relevant agents | Validation across layers |
| **Refinement** | Service specialist | R5-D4 (documentation) | Lessons learned capture |

**Coordination Protocol**: Follow Constitution Section X-XVIII (Inter-Agent Collaboration)

---

## 3. Phase 1: Planning

### 3.1 Objective

Create a **comprehensive deployment plan** before executing any commands. The plan serves as the contract between agents and provides the roadmap for execution.

### 3.2 Planning Inputs

**Required Information:**
- Service name and version
- Target server (from Platform Nodes document)
- Architecture layer assignment (from Architecture document)
- Integration requirements (APIs, databases, dependencies)

---

## 4. Phase 2: Prerequisites

### 4.1 Objective

Ensure the environment is **ready to receive the deployment**. All dependencies, accounts, infrastructure, and configuration must be in place before deployment begins.

### 4.2 Standard Prerequisites Categories

#### 4.2.1 Infrastructure Foundation
**Agent Responsible**: Chewbacca (per Constitution Section V)

**Scope**:
- Domain service account creation
- DNS record configuration
- SSL/TLS certificate deployment

**Coordination**:
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Infrastructure foundation complete (Chewbacca confirms)
- [ ] OS preparation complete (BB-8 confirms)
- [ ] All dependencies available
- [ ] Configuration files prepared
- [ ] Integration endpoints verified
- [ ] No blockers or unresolved issues

**If any validation fails:** Do not proceed. Resolve the issue first.

---

## 5. Phase 3: Deployment

### 5.1 Objective

Execute the deployment plan **task by task**, validating after each step, until the service is operational.

### 5.2 Deployment Principles

**1. One Task at a Time**
- Complete task N fully before starting task N+1
- Validate task N before proceeding

**2. Validate Continuously**
- Run validation checks after every task
- Do not assume successâ€”verify it

**3. Document in Real-Time**
- Update deployment log as you work
- Capture commands, outputs, decisions

**4. Coordinate Transparently**
- When calling another agent, document the handoff
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding

**5. Stop on Error**
- If validation fails twice, STOP
- Escalate per Constitution Section XV

### 5.3 Standard Deployment Task Sequence

**Typical tasks (adapt per service):**

1. **Environment Verification**: Confirm prereqs still valid
2. **Installation/Build**: Install from package, build from source, or extract binary
3. **Configuration**: Apply service-specific configuration
4. **Database Initialization**: If service has database/schema
5. **Service User/Permissions**: Apply ownership (using account from Chewbacca)
6. **Systemd Service Creation**: Create unit file, enable service
7. **Service Startup**: Start the service
8. **Smoke Test**: Basic functionality test (local access)
9. **Network Configuration**: Configure listen addresses, ports
10. **Integration Test**: Test connections to dependencies (databases, APIs)

**Reference Deployment Patterns**: See Section 8 (Deployment Patterns Library)

### 5.4 Validation at Each Task

**Every task must include validation:**

```bash
# Example: After starting a service

# Validation 1: Service Status
sudo systemctl status myservice

# Validation 2: Process Running
ps aux | grep myservice

# Validation 3: Port Listening
ss -tlnp | grep <port>

# Validation 4: Log Check
sudo journalctl -u myservice -n 50 --no-pager

# Validation 5: Smoke Test
curl http://localhost:<port>/health
```

**If any validation fails:**
- Attempt to diagnose (1-2 attempts)
- If unresolved, STOP and escalate

### 5.5 Rollback Triggers

**Execute rollback if:**
- Any critical task fails twice
- Service fails to start after configuration
- Integration tests reveal blocking issues
- Security validation fails
- Data corruption or loss risk identified

**Rollback Process:**
1. Stop the service (if running)
2. Execute rollback procedures (per deployment plan)
3. Restore previous state
4. Document what happened
5. Analyze root cause before retrying

---

## 6. Phase 4: Post-Deployment

### 6.1 Objective

Verify the service is **fully integrated** into the ecosystem and performing as expected.

### 6.2 Integration Verification

**Layer Integration Checks:**

**Layer 1 (Identity & Trust)**:
- [ ] Service authenticates against hx-dc-server
- [ ] TLS certificate valid and in use
- [ ] DNS resolution working

**Layer 2 (Model & Inference)** (if applicable):
- [ ] Service can reach LiteLLM gateway
- [ ] LLM requests successful
- [ ] Routing logic working

**Layer 3 (Data Plane)** (if applicable):
- [ ] Database connections successful
- [ ] Redis cache accessible
- [ ] Qdrant vector operations working

**Layer 4 (Agentic & Toolchain)** (if applicable):
- [ ] MCP endpoints responding
- [ ] Tool calls successful
- [ ] Worker nodes processing jobs

**Layer 5 (Application)** (if applicable):
- [ ] UI accessible through hx-ssl-server
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] AG-UI protocol functional (if using CopilotKit)

**Layer 6 (Integration & Governance)**:
- [ ] Service appears in monitoring (future)
- [ ] Logs accessible
- [ ] Documentation updated

### 6.3 End-to-End Testing

**Execute realistic workflows:**

Example for RAG service:
1. User submits query through UI
2. Query routed through LiteLLM
3. Vector search executed in Qdrant
4. Context retrieved
5. LLM generates response
6. Response returned to user

**Validation**: All steps complete without errors

### 6.4 Performance Validation

**Baseline Performance Checks:**
- Response times acceptable (< 5s for typical requests)
- Resource usage normal (CPU, memory, disk)
- No errors in logs
- Service stable over 15-minute observation

### 6.5 Documentation Updates

**Required Updates:**

1. **Platform Nodes Document**:
   - Update server status (â¬œ â†’ ðŸ› ï¸ â†’ âœ…)
   - Add service details to server description

2. **Deployment Log**:
   - Final summary of deployment
   - Metrics (time, tasks, issues)
   - Success confirmation

3. **Service-Specific Documentation** (create):

| Uncertain after 2 attempts | Agent Zero | Constitution Section XV |

**Communication Protocol:**
- Use standard format from Constitution Section XVI
- Provide complete context
- Wait for confirmation
- Document the interaction

**Handoff Best Practices:**
- Clear, specific requests
- Complete context provided
- Success criteria defined

---

## 9. Deployment Patterns Library

### 9.1 Pattern 1: Package-Based Deployment

**Example**: Most system services (Redis, PostgreSQL from packages)

**Characteristics**:
- Service available in package manager
- Standard installation path
- Systemd unit file included
- Configuration in `/etc/[service]/`

**Typical Steps**:
1. Add repository (if needed)
2. `apt update && apt install [package]`
3. Configure in `/etc/[service]/`
4. `systemctl enable [service]`
5. `systemctl start [service]`
6. Validate

**Pros**: Simple, reliable, well-supported  
**Cons**: Version may lag upstream

---

### 9.2 Pattern 2: Source-Based Deployment

**Example**: PostgreSQL (compiled from source for latest version)

**Characteristics**:
- Download source tarball
- Compile with specific options
- Custom installation path
- Manual systemd unit creation

**Typical Steps**:
1. Install build dependencies
2. Download and verify source
3. `./configure --prefix=/usr/local/[service]`
4. `make && make install`
5. Create systemd unit file
6. Configure service
7. `systemctl enable && start`
8. Validate

**Pros**: Latest version, custom options  
**Cons**: More complex, requires build tools

---

### 9.3 Pattern 3: Binary Deployment

**Example**: Qdrant (pre-compiled binary)

**Characteristics**:
- Download binary release
- Extract to target directory
- Create systemd unit file
- Minimal dependencies

**Typical Steps**:
1. Download binary from GitHub/website
2. Verify checksum
3. Extract to `/usr/local/bin/` or `/opt/[service]/`
4. Set permissions
5. Create systemd unit file
6. Configure (config file or environment vars)
7. `systemctl enable && start`
8. Validate

**Pros**: No compilation, fast deployment  
**Cons**: Specific to architecture (amd64, arm64)

---

### 9.4 Pattern 4: Container Deployment

**Example**: Future containerized services

**Characteristics**:
- Pull container image
- Docker/Podman runtime
- Volume mounts for persistence
- Network configuration

**Typical Steps**:
1. Ensure container runtime installed
2. `docker pull [image]` or `podman pull [image]`
3. Create volume mounts
4. Create container with config
5. `docker/podman start [container]`
6. Validate

**Pros**: Isolation, portability, consistency  
**Cons**: Additional runtime layer

**Status**: Methodology for containers evolving as we gain experience

---

### 9.5 Pattern 5: MCP Server Deployment

**Example**: Docling MCP, Crawl4AI MCP, QMCP

**Characteristics**:
- Python-based MCP servers
- Virtual environment for dependencies
- Systemd unit with environment activation
- Integration with FastMCP gateway (optional)

**Typical Steps**:
1. Create Python virtual environment
2. Install MCP server package
3. Create configuration file
4. Create systemd unit file (activates venv)
5. `systemctl enable && start`
6. Test MCP protocol endpoints
7. Register with FastMCP (if using gateway)
8. Validate tool calls

**Special Considerations**:
- MCP protocol compliance testing
- Tool discovery verification
- Integration with LiteLLM (tool call brokering)

**Reference**: Architecture Section 3.3 (MCP Integration Backbone)

## 15. Summary: The HX Deployment Way

**Systematic â†’ Coordinated â†’ Validated â†’ Documented â†’ Refined**

### Core Principles:

1. **Read the Governance First** - Constitution, Architecture, Platform Nodes
2. **Plan Before Executing** - Framework before commands
3. **Coordinate Transparently** - Follow Constitution protocols
4. **Validate Continuously** - After every task
5. **Document in Real-Time** - Not post-facto
6. **Stop on Failure** - Never push through errors
7. **Learn from Each Deployment** - Improve the methodology
8. **Reference, Don't Repeat** - Leverage governance documents
9. **Agent Collaboration** - Multiple agents, one team
10. **Quality Always** - Per Constitution Principle I

### The Formula:

```
Quality Deployment = 
    (Thorough Planning) 
    Ã— (Agent Coordination) 
    Ã— (Continuous Validation) 
    Ã— (Real-Time Documentation)
    Ã— (Iterative Learning)
```

**"Follow the governance, coordinate with peers, validate every step."**
