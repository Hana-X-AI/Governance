## Prioritization Framework

### Priority Definitions
- **P0**: Critical - Must have for release, blocks other work
- **P1**: High - Important for release, significant user value
- **P2**: Medium - Nice to have, can be deferred if needed
- **P3**: Low - Future consideration, low impact

### Value vs Effort Matrix

```
High Value, Low Effort  → P0/P1 (Do First)
High Value, High Effort → P1/P2 (Plan Carefully)
Low Value, Low Effort   → P2/P3 (Fill Capacity)
Low Value, High Effort  → P3/Icebox (Avoid)
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Items
1. Assign unique ID (BI-###)
2. Define clear user story
3. Set acceptance criteria
4. Estimate story points
5. Assess business value and effort
6. Set initial priority
7. Identify dependencies
8. Update backlog summary

### Refining Items
1. Review and clarify requirements
2. Break down large items (>8 points)
3. Update acceptance criteria
4. Re-estimate if needed
5. Validate dependencies
6. Ensure item is "Ready"

### Prioritizing Items
1. Assess business value
2. Consider technical dependencies
3. Evaluate effort vs value
4. Align with release goals
5. Update priority
6. Reorder backlog

### Moving to Sprint
1. Verify item is "Ready"
2. Confirm dependencies resolved
3. Assign to team member
4. Update status to "In Progress"
5. Move to Current Sprint section
