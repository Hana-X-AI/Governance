# Task List: [WORK ITEM NAME]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Orchestrating Agent**: [@agent-name]
**Task Size**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
**Work Plan**: [Link to work plan if exists, or N/A]
**Specification**: [Link to spec if exists, or N/A]

---

## Quick Guidelines

✅ **Mark parallel tasks with [P]** - These can run simultaneously (different systems, no dependencies)
✅ **Mark sequential tasks with [S]** - These must run in order (blocked by previous tasks)
✅ **Note dependencies** - Use `[Blocked by: T###]` for any task that waits on another
✅ **Assign agents** - Every task has a clear owner
✅ **Validate each step** - Include expected outcome and validation method

---

## Task Execution Format

**Format**: `[ID] [P/S] @agent-name - Description`
- **[P]**: Parallel execution (different systems, no dependencies)
- **[S]**: Sequential execution (blocked by other tasks)
- **[Blocked by: T###]**: Task dependencies
- Include specific resources (servers, IPs, files, services)

**Example**:
```
□ T001 [P] @agent-frank - Create service account 'svc-docling' in FreeIPA
  Expected outcome: Account created, credentials available
  Validation: ldapsearch -x -b "dc=hx,dc=dev,dc=local" uid=svc-docling

□ T002 [P] @agent-william - Prepare hx-docling-server (192.168.10.216)
  Expected outcome: Server provisioned, domain-joined, SSH access
  Validation: ssh svc-admin@hx-docling-server

□ T003 [S] @agent-elena - Install Docling Worker service
  [Blocked by: T001, T002]
  Expected outcome: Service installed, configured, not yet started
  Validation: systemctl status docling-worker (expect inactive)
```

---

## Phase Structure

Tasks are organized by execution phase. Not all phases are required for all work. Adjust based on task complexity.

### PRE-FLIGHT (Sequential - Setup & Validation)
Tasks that MUST run before main work begins.

**Examples**:
- Backup current configuration
- Run baseline tests
- Verify prerequisites
- Check disk space/resources

### PHASE 1: PREPARATION (Parallel Opportunities)
Independent preparation tasks that can run simultaneously.

**Examples**:
- Download models/packages
- Create service accounts
- Provision servers
- Update DNS records
- Generate SSL certificates

### PHASE 2: DEPLOYMENT (Sequential - Often Blocked by Phase 1)
Tasks that must run in specific order, often blocked by preparation tasks.

**Examples**:
- Stop services
- Update configurations
- Install packages
- Start services
- Initialize databases

### PHASE 3: VALIDATION (Parallel Tests)
Post-deployment validation that can often run in parallel.

**Examples**:
- Health checks
- Functional tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests

### ROLLBACK (If Needed)
Tasks to restore previous state if validation fails.

**Examples**:
- Restore backed-up configs
- Restart services
- Clear caches
- Revert DNS changes

  Expected outcome: [What success looks like]
  Validation: [How to verify]
```

**Example**:
```
□ P1 [P] @agent-patricia - Download docling-v2.5 model to Ollama (192.168.10.204)

  Expected outcome: New config staged at /srv/docling-worker/config-v2.5.yaml
  Validation: diff /srv/docling-worker/config.yaml /srv/docling-worker/config-v2.5.yaml
```

### CHECKPOINT: Phase 1 Complete?

**Before proceeding to Phase 2**:
- [ ] All parallel tasks completed?
- [ ] All deliverables validated?
- [ ] Ready to proceed with sequential deployment?
- [ ] Rollback plan clear if Phase 2 fails?

---

### PHASE 2: DEPLOYMENT *(Sequential - Blocked by Phase 1)*

**WARNING**: These tasks MUST run in order. Do not skip validation between tasks.

```
□ S1 [S] @agent-name - [Task description]
  [Blocked by: P1, P2, P3]
  Expected outcome: [What success looks like]
  Validation: [How to verify]

□ S2 [S] @agent-name - [Task description]
  [Blocked by: S1]
  Expected outcome: [What success looks like]
  Validation: [How to verify]
```

**Example**:
```
□ S1 [S] @agent-elena - Stop Docling Worker service
  [Blocked by: P1, P2, P3]
  Expected outcome: Service stopped gracefully, no errors in logs
  Validation: systemctl status docling-worker (expect inactive)

□ S2 [S] @agent-elena - Replace Docling Worker config with v2.5 version
  [Blocked by: S1]
  Expected outcome: Config file replaced, backup preserved
  Validation: grep "docling-v2.5" /srv/docling-worker/config.yaml

□ S3 [S] @agent-elena - Start Docling Worker with new config
  [Blocked by: S2]
  Expected outcome: Service started, model loads successfully, no errors
  Validation: systemctl status docling-worker (expect active), journalctl -u docling-worker -n 50

□ S4 [S] @agent-eric - Restart Docling MCP to apply v2.5 config
  [Blocked by: S3]
  Expected outcome: MCP service restarted, connects to Worker successfully
  Validation: systemctl status docling-mcp, curl http://hx-docling-mcp-server/health
```

### CHECKPOINT: Phase 2 Complete?

**Before proceeding to validation**:
- [ ] All sequential tasks executed in order?
- [ ] Each task validated before proceeding?
- [ ] Services running and healthy?
- [ ] No errors in logs?
- [ ] Ready for integration testing?

---

### PHASE 3: VALIDATION *(Parallel Tests)*

**CHECKPOINT**: Can these tests run simultaneously? They should test different aspects or be read-only.

```
□ T3 [P] @agent-name - [Functional test]
  Expected outcome: [Test passes]
  Validation: [How to verify]

□ T4 [P] @agent-name - [Integration test]
  Expected outcome: [Test passes]
  Validation: [How to verify]
```

**Example**:
```
□ T3 [P] @agent-julia - Functional test: Process test document via Worker
  Expected outcome: Document processed successfully, valid output, <50s
  Validation: Review test output, check processing time

□ T4 [P] @agent-julia - Integration test: LightRAG → Docling MCP → Worker flow
  Expected outcome: End-to-end flow works, LightRAG receives valid output
  Validation: Check LightRAG logs, verify document ingested

□ T5 [P] @agent-julia - Performance test: Process 10 documents, measure time
  Expected outcome: Average ≤45s per document (meets baseline)
  Validation: Review performance metrics, compare to baseline (T001)

□ T6 [P] @agent-elena - Monitor Docling Worker logs for 15 minutes
  Expected outcome: No errors, no warnings, stable resource usage
  Validation: journalctl -u docling-worker --since "15 minutes ago" | grep -i error
```

---

### CHECKPOINT: Validation Complete?

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All functional tests passed?
- [ ] All integration tests passed?
- [ ] Performance meets targets?
- [ ] No errors in logs?
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met (from spec)?
- [ ] Documentation updated?

**If any criterion fails → Proceed to ROLLBACK**

---

### ROLLBACK: Restore Previous State *(If Validation Failed)*

**TRIGGER**: Execute if validation fails or critical errors occur.

```
□ R1 [S] @agent-name - [Rollback step]
  Expected outcome: [Service restored to previous state]
  Validation: [How to verify rollback succeeded]
```

**Example**:
```
□ R1 [S] @agent-elena - Stop Docling Worker
  Expected outcome: Service stopped
  Validation: systemctl status docling-worker (expect inactive)

□ R2 [S] @agent-elena - Restore backed-up config
  [Blocked by: R1]
  Expected outcome: Original config restored from /srv/backups/
  Validation: diff original vs current config (should match)

□ R3 [S] @agent-elena - Start Docling Worker with original config
  [Blocked by: R2]
  Expected outcome: Service running with v2.3 model (original)
  Validation: systemctl status docling-worker, verify v2.3 in logs

□ R4 [S] @agent-eric - Revert Docling MCP config to v2.3
  [Blocked by: R3]
  Expected outcome: MCP points to v2.3 again
  Validation: grep "docling-v2.3" /srv/docling-mcp/config.yaml

□ R5 [S] @agent-julia - Verify rollback: Process test document
  [Blocked by: R4]
  Expected outcome: Document processes successfully with v2.3
  Validation: Confirm test passes, system back to baseline
```
