---

File: src/auth.py:42
Error: Hardcoded API key detected
API_KEY = 'sk-1234567890abcdef' found in source code. This is a critical security vulnerability.
Move sensitive data to environment variables. Use .env file and load with os.getenv().
Reference: OWASP A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures

---

File: src/database.py:89
Warning: SQL injection vulnerability
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + user_id)
User input is directly concatenated into SQL query without sanitization.
Use parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Reference: OWASP A03:2021 - Injection

---

File: src/services/user_service.py:15
Warning: Single Responsibility Principle violation
Class UserService handles multiple responsibilities: database operations, email sending, and data validation.
Each class should have only one reason to change. Extract email and validation logic into separate classes.
Reference: Hana-X Standards Section 2.1 - SOLID Principles

---

File: src/utils/helpers.py:23
Info: Missing type hints
def process_data(input, config):
Function parameters and return type lack type annotations.
Add type hints to all function parameters and return types for better code clarity and IDE support.
Reference: Hana-X Standards Section 6.1 - Python Standards

---

File: src/models/shape.py:56
Warning: Open-Closed Principle violation
if isinstance(shape, Circle): calculate_circle_area()
Using isinstance checks violates OCP. Code must be modified to add new shape types.
Use polymorphism: define calculate_area() method in base Shape class, override in subclasses.
Reference: Hana-X Standards Section 2.2 - SOLID Principles

---

File: src/api/endpoints.py:103
Info: Missing docstring
def complex_endpoint_handler():
Function lacks documentation explaining purpose, parameters, and return value.
Add comprehensive docstring with description, args, returns, and example usage.
Reference: Hana-X Standards Section 3.1 - Documentation

---

File: src/processors/data_processor.py:67
Info: High cyclomatic complexity
Function process_batch() has complexity of 15 (threshold: 10)
Function is too complex with nested conditionals and loops.
Extract sub-functions to reduce complexity and improve readability.
Reference: Clean Code - Functions Should Do One Thing

---

File: src/interfaces/base_interface.py:12
Suggestion: Interface Segregation Principle
Interface IDataProcessor has 18 methods, but most implementations only use 4.
Split into smaller, focused interfaces. Clients should not depend on methods they don't use.
Reference: Hana-X Standards Section 2.4 - SOLID Principles
