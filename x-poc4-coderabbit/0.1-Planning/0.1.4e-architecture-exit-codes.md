echo $?

# Exit codes (Unix-aligned scheme):
# 0   = Success - All checks passed, no issues found
#       CI/Automation: Proceed with deployment/merge
#
# 1   = Issues Found - Code review identified problems (P0/P1/P2)
#       CI/Automation: Requires code fixes; fail build but allow retry after remediation
#
# 2   = CLI Usage Error - Invalid arguments, unknown options, or incorrect command syntax
#       CI/Automation: Fix CI script/command invocation; not a code problem
#
# 3   = Configuration Error - Missing environment variables, invalid config files, or auth failure
#       CI/Automation: Fix environment setup (secrets, config, tokens); not a code problem
#
# 4   = Unrecoverable System Error - Out of memory, disk full, I/O failure, or system resource exhaustion
#       CI/Automation: Investigate infrastructure; retry may succeed after resource cleanup
#
# 127 = Command Not Found - 'coderabbit' executable not in PATH or not installed
#       CI/Automation: Install CodeRabbit CLI or fix PATH; environment setup issue
#
# 128+ = Terminated by Signal - Process killed by signal (e.g., 130 = SIGINT/Ctrl+C, 137 = SIGKILL, 143 = SIGTERM)
#       CI/Automation: Timeout, manual interrupt, or forced termination; investigate timeout settings
#
# Purpose: Differentiate between code issues (exit 1, requires developer action) and environment/config
# issues (exits 2/3/4/127, requires DevOps/CI action). This allows automation to route failures correctly.

## Prompts You Can Use

### During Development
```
"Run CodeRabbit on my changes"
"Check for any issues before I commit"
"Do a quick security scan"
"Make sure my code follows Hana-X standards"
```

### For Fixing
```
"Fix all the issues CodeRabbit found"
"Fix only P0 issues"
"Show me how to fix the P1 issues"
"Apply the suggested fixes"
```

### For Verification
```
"Run CodeRabbit again to verify"
"Check if that fix worked"
"Make sure we're clean now"
```

### For Reporting
```
"What issues did CodeRabbit find?"
"Give me a summary of code quality"
"List all security issues"
"Save the findings to the defect log"
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Review Early and Often
```
✅ Do: Review after each feature
❌ Don't: Wait until the end to review everything
```

### 2. Fix Critical Issues Immediately
```
✅ Do: "Fix all P0 issues right now"
❌ Don't: "I'll fix those later"
```

### 3. Let Claude Do the Fixing
```
✅ Do: "Fix the issues CodeRabbit found"
❌ Don't: Manually fix while Claude could do it
```

### 4. Verify After Fixes
```
✅ Do: "Run CodeRabbit again to verify"
❌ Don't: Assume fixes worked without checking
```

### 5. Use Specific Commands
```
✅ Do: "Run security scan with CodeRabbit"
❌ Don't: "Check security" (too vague)
