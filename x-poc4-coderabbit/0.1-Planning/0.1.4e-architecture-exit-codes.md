## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Review Early and Often
```
✅ Do: Review after each feature
❌ Don't: Wait until the end to review everything
```

### 2. Fix Critical Issues Immediately
```
✅ Do: "Fix all P0 issues right now"
❌ Don't: "I'll fix those later"
```

### 3. Let Claude Do the Fixing
```
✅ Do: "Fix the issues CodeRabbit found"
❌ Don't: Manually fix while Claude could do it
```

### 4. Verify After Fixes
```
✅ Do: "Run CodeRabbit again to verify"
❌ Don't: Assume fixes worked without checking
```

### 5. Use Specific Commands
```
✅ Do: "Run security scan with CodeRabbit"
❌ Don't: "Check security" (too vague)
