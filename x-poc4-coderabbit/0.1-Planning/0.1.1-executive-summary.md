# Roger & CodeRabbit: Automated Code Quality
**One-Page Summary for Engineering Team**

---

## What Is This?

An **AI-powered code review system** that automatically checks your code against Hana-X standards, finds bugs, and tracks defects - **without slowing you down**.

Think: **Senior engineer reviews every commit, instantly, 24/7**

---

## How It Works
````
You Write Code → Commit → Roger Reviews → Issues Found? → You Fix → Done
                                              ↓ No Issues
                                         ✅ Ready to Deploy
````

**Roger** = AI agent that manages the review process  
**CodeRabbit** = AI that actually reviews the code  
**Your Workflow** = Unchanged (git commit/push as usual)

---

## What Gets Checked

✅ **SOLID Principles** (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, etc.)  
✅ **Code Quality** (type hints, docs, complexity, duplication)  
✅ **Security** (no hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS)  
✅ **Testing** (80% coverage minimum)  
✅ **Standards** (FastAPI, React, Next.js, Tailwind best practices)

---

## The Smart Part: Install Once, Use Everywhere

### Old Way (Per-Project)
- Install Roger in every project
- Takes 17 days per project
- 3 projects = 51 days

### New Way (Shared Infrastructure)
- Install Roger **once** on server
- All projects use it immediately
- 3 projects = 1 day + 40 minutes

**Result**: 50+ days saved 🎉

## What Changes for You?

### Before ✅ (Stays The Same)
````bash
vim src/my_feature.py  # Write code
git add .              # Stage changes
git commit -m "..."    # Commit
git push               # Push
````

### After ✅ (Also Stays The Same, But Better)
````bash
vim src/my_feature.py  # Write code
git add .              # Stage changes
git commit -m "..."    # Commit ← Roger reviews here (auto)
                       #   ↓ Shows issues instantly
git push               # Push ← Only if no critical issues
````

**Your Tools**: Still use VS Code, PyCharm, etc.  
**Your Workflow**: Still commit, push, PR  
**New Superpower**: Instant feedback on every commit

## Example: What You'll See

### Good Commit ✅
````bash
$ git commit -m "Add user auth"
🐰 Roger: Reviewing...
✅ No issues found. Ready to push.
````

### Issues Found ⚠️
````bash
$ git commit -m "Add payments"
🐰 Roger: Reviewing...
⚠️  3 issues found:
  🔴 P0: Hardcoded API key (payment.py:42)
  🟡 P1: Missing error handling
  ⚫ P2: Function too complex

📝 Logged to DEFECT-LOG.md
🔧 Fix P0 before pushing

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What | Impact on You |
|-------|----------|------|---------------|
| Setup Infrastructure | 1 day | Install on server | None - background |
| Configure Project | 30 min | Link to infrastructure | Minimal |
| Training | 1 hour | Team demo | Learn commands |
| Pilot (monitoring) | 1 week | Roger reports only | Try it out |
| Pilot (enforcement) | 1 week | Must fix P0/P1 | Real usage |
| Full Rollout | Ongoing | All projects | Daily benefit |

---

## Cost vs Benefit

### Investment
- **Time**: 2 days total (mostly setup)
- **Learning**: 1 hour training + practice

### Return
- **Saves**: 2-4 hours per PR (no waiting for reviews)
- **Prevents**: 5-10 production bugs per month
- **Improves**: Code quality automatically
- **Speeds**: Onboarding new developers (3 days vs 2 weeks)

**ROI**: ~500 hours saved per year for 5-person team

---

## FAQ (Quick Answers)

**Q**: Will it slow me down?  
**A**: No. Runs in background. Keep working immediately.

**Q**: Can I disable it?  
**A**: Yes (git commit --no-verify) but needs approval for deployment.

**Q**: What if I disagree with a finding?  
**A**: Annotate code with reason or discuss with team lead.

**Q**: Does it replace code reviews?  
**A**: No. Complements them. Catches common issues so reviewers focus on logic.

**Q**: New projects?  
**A**: 5 minutes: `hx-new-project my-project` - done!
