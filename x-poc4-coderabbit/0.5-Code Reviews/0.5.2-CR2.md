✅ Changes Made
File: CODERABBIT-FIX-t041-browser-test-failure-criteria.md

Location: Added after line 257 (after the "After (v1.1)" example)

New Section Added: "How to Check Browser Console"
1. Opening the Console (multi-platform):

Windows/Linux: F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I
macOS: Cmd+Option+I
Alternative: Right-click → "Inspect" → "Console" tab
2. Visual Indicators:

❌ Red errors: Blocking issues (must fix)
⚠️ Orange warnings: Non-critical (review recommended)
ℹ️ Blue info: Informational (usually safe)
3. Common Error Patterns (7 examples):

Failed to load resource: - Missing files/network
TypeError: - JavaScript coding errors
SyntaxError: - Malformed code
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED - Service down
401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden - Auth issues
500 Internal Server Error - Backend errors
4. Clear Pass/Fail Criteria:

PASS: No red errors
FAIL: Any red errors present
Impact
This addition helps inexperienced operators by:

✅ Providing exact keyboard shortcuts for all platforms
✅ Teaching what different console messages mean
✅ Giving specific error strings to watch for
✅ Setting clear pass/fail criteria
✅ Reducing confusion and false positives
The guidance is concise (~15 lines) and actionable, making it easy for users unfamiliar with browser dev tools to perform proper testing.
