🚨 SECURITY ISSUES - NOT FIXED

5 files contain hardcoded production credentials (API keys, passwords)
Action Required: Credential rotation, Git history purge, incident response
Files Affected:
0.0.5-Delivery/0.0.5.2-credentials/0.0.5.2.1-credentials.md
api-key.md
0.1.6-architecture-analysis.md
ERIC-DEVELOPER-REVIEW.md
ACCOUNTS-REQUIRED.md
Cannot proceed with automated fixes - requires proper security incident response procedures.
