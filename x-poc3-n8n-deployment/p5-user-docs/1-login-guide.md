## What is N8N?

N8N is a workflow automation tool that helps you connect different apps and services together. Think of it as a way to make your apps work together automatically, without writing code.

For example, you could:
- Automatically save email attachments to cloud storage
- Get notifications when something important happens
- Move data between different tools you use every day

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Page cannot be displayed" or "Connection refused"

**Solution**: Try these steps:
1. Check your spelling - make sure the URL is exactly: `https://n8n.hx.dev.local`
2. Try the IP address instead: `https://192.168.10.215`
3. Ask IT support to check if the N8N server is running

### Problem: "Your connection is not private" or "Certificate warning"

**Solution**: This is normal for internal systems!
- Click **"Advanced"** or **"More Information"**
- Click **"Proceed anyway"** or **"Accept the Risk and Continue"**
- This happens because we use an internal security certificate

### Problem: "Login failed" or "Invalid credentials"

**Solution**: Double-check your login details:
- Username: `caio` (no @ symbol, no domain)
- Password: `Major8859!` (capital M, capital M, exclamation mark at the end)
- Make sure Caps Lock is OFF

### Problem: "Forgot my password"

**Solution**:
- Contact IT support to reset your password
- Or check the credentials document in the Governance folder
